## REQUIREMENTS:

1. Libraries used are: numpy opencv tqdm

2. ```pip install numpy``` , ```pip install tqdm``` , ```pip install opencv-python```

3. Inbuilt python modules used: ```copy,time,typing,ordered_set,queue```

## Steps to run the code and see output:

1. The python executable is stored in proj2.py

2. The output of this file will be generated in viz folder. Please make sure the directory which contains this script as a viz folder, if not, open a terminal and
   type ```mkdir viz```
   
3. once requirements of step 2 are met, and all the dependencies mentionied earlier section are installed, please open a terminal in this directory and type
   ```python3 dijkstra_Vedant_Ranade.py```
   
4. You will now be prompted to enter Start and End point coordinates, if the start and end point coordinates and invalid, you will be prompted about it and the code will end execution
   Rerun the python script and add points which are valid
   
5. The output will be stored in the viz folder under PathViz0.mp4

6. The base map is a offwhite image

7. Obstacles are marked as blue

8. The green part shows explored nodes

9. The red dot is how the robot moves

10. For the worst cases , djikstra solver takes 10 seconds, and viz takes 40seconds

## Random output:

1. The default output was generated by running the script with start = 6,6 (Y,X) and end point = 120,594 (Y,X)
2. The default output video is in the viz folder, with the name "PathVizRand.mp4"

## Warning:
1. Sometimes when I ran the python script, my terminal hung up. This never happened in the ipynb notebook where i worked originally
2. If this happens, please restart the terminal. I havent found a reason why this should happen.
